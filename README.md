# FacepileStackViewExample
**UIStackView extension to show nice facepile with overlapping and number of faces remains**

To create facepile:

* prepare a dictionary with images of faces. 
* setup parameters like overlapping images (from 0.00 to 1.00), facepile size and size of font. 
* call `show(...)` method from UIStackView extension. 

Here is the demo of how it works.
